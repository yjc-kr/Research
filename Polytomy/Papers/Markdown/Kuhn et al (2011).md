## Abstract

> 1. Unresolved nodes in phylogenetic trees (polytomies) have long been recognized for their influences on specific phylogenetic metrics such as topological imbalance measures, diversification rate analysis and measures of phylogenetic diversity. However, no rigorously tested, biologically appropriate method has been proposed for overcoming the effects of this phylogenetic uncertainty.
> 2. Here, we present a simple approach
