# 1. Mosaic Variants During Lifetime

## 1.1. Introduction
- p.1.
  - Mosaic genome variation = difference in DNA sequence b/w cells of the same individual
    - Types
      - Single nucleotide variants (SNV)
      - Small insertions and deletions (indel)
      - Structural variants = variants other than SNV and indel
        - Copy number alterations (CNA)
        - Copy number neutral losses of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH)
        - Sequence inversions
        - Interchromosomal translocations
        - Chromosomal aneuploidies
        - Multiploidies
        - Insertions of retrotransposable elemtents
  - Variants that reduce cell proliferation or viability are likely to be less frequent in a tissue.
  - Variants that increase proliferation or viability will likely be more frequent.

## 1.2. Mosaic Variants in Development and Aging

- p.3.
  - Rates at which genomes accumulate mutations in development and aging are only partially known.
